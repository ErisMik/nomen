January 2nd, 2016
- Began research into the various APIs that I plan to use. 
- Deciding what language to use, stuck betweeen Python, C++ or Java.
- Starting to create the graphical outline of the program

January 3rd, 2016
- Got API keys for Steam and League of Legends
- Tested grabbing the data, using curl requests and parsing data
- Can't just grab steam friends list, must grab the list of friends and then check their status individually
- In test.py I created a test to retrive and print out the status of the user's friends in steam
- Apparently I struggle to understad JSON :P
- Converted the Steam test into a library module
