Field Notes: Computer Science IA
================================

January 2nd, 2016
- Began research into the various APIs that I plan to use. 
- Deciding what language to use, stuck betweeen Python, C++ or Java.
- Starting to create the graphical outline of the program

January 3rd, 2016
- Got API keys for Steam and League of Legends
- Tested grabbing the data, using curl requests and parsing data
- Can't just grab steam friends list, must grab the list of friends and then check their status individually
- In test.py I created a test to retrive and print out the status of the user's friends in steam
- Apparently I struggle to understad JSON :P
- Converted the Steam test into a library module

January 4th, 2016
- Worked on the graphical user interface
- Got the API keys for GW2, Hipchat and Slack
- Planned the user interface on paper
- Following a Tkinter tutorial
- Began to build the graphical user interface in the test.py
- Tried to add a scrollbar to the window
- Had to use a Listbox as the widget type because it is the only one that will allow me to scroll
- Added tools.py to the library, added in a function to it that grabs the Auth key of a service
- Moved the graphics from the test.py to a library module
- Ran into difficulty getting the steam api calls to fit into the OOP graphical module

January 5th, 2016
- Got a client (Peter Fajner) to test it on his windows 10 machine
- The buttons are the incorrect colour, this will need to be fixed
- Got the steam api calls into the Tkinter update loop
- Optimized the steam API call to make a single call for all entries rather than two calls per entry

January 6th, 2016
- Minor cleanup
- Began to work on testing another api with the app (League of Legends)

January 12th, 2016
- Tried out a CI server to do build testing, didn't work out so I reverted my changes

January 31st, 2016
- Started implemeting the League API into a library module
- Had to determine a workaround because League doesn't allow you to get them directly
- Finished implementing the League API into the library module
- Got the league module working with the full application

February 3rd, 2016
- Implementing changes in order to get py2app working so that I can distribute my application easier
- testing getting py2app working, unsuccessful getting a working build but making progress

February 4th, 2016
- Added the actual code to get the set friends for the league api
- Tried bug fixing the read files
- Bug turned out to be that the league api limits me to 10 api calls per 10 seconds, and I've violated that by accidently having more than 4 friends
- Branched git to work on threading the program so I can limit the API calls easier
- Multithreading basics done
- Python is basically cheating
- Improving the API calls using qeues
- GIT Exploded so I just moved all my code to the master branch and deleted the other branches

February 5th, 2016
- Branched my git code to begin working on the plugins feature of the program
- League appears to be some minutes ahead of my computer? Will need to hardcode in an adjustment

February 7th, 2016
- Continued to work on the plugins system
- Determined how to dynamically import modules
- Listed directory and dynamically imported all files from it (plugins)
- Used each of the dynamically imported plugins to read statuses
- Dynamically printed the statuses into main window
- This changed the headers of the sections as they are no longer hardcoded, I will need to pass along an additional piece of information
- Minor cleanup
- Started working on the sorting system

February 8th, 2016
- Worked on the new sorting method

February 9th, 2016
- Continued to work on the new sorting method
- Tested it by passing in Null data and poorley handling it :P
- The whole program is very inefficient, rather than storing data that doesn't change in reads/calculates it every update cycle. This means changes can be made on the fly... It's a feature not a bug!!!
- Figured out a way to map known friends to their statuses, could be done in a much more effective manner but oh well
- Got the update status function working, you can now sort by application or by person, however this must be hardcoded for now 

February 10th, 2016
- Worked on getting the buttons working
- THey work, I think. I can't properly test it at school so I'm just crossing my fingers
- It doesn't work in a live setting, I think it's because I'm setting the variable in the aarguments??? Why I decided to do this I dunno, attempting a fix
- It works!!! Tested and everything. Sorintg is now 97.6% complete!

February 13th, 2016
- Starting to work on the filtering system
