Field Notes: Computer Science IA
================================

January 2nd, 2016
- Began research into the various APIs that I plan to use. 
- Deciding what language to use, stuck betweeen Python, C++ or Java.
- Starting to create the graphical outline of the program

January 3rd, 2016
- Got API keys for Steam and League of Legends
- Tested grabbing the data, using curl requests and parsing data
- Can't just grab steam friends list, must grab the list of friends and then check their status individually
- In test.py I created a test to retrive and print out the status of the user's friends in steam
- Apparently I struggle to understad JSON :P
- Converted the Steam test into a library module

January 4th, 2016
- Worked on the graphical user interface
- Got the API keys for GW2, Hipchat and Slack
- Planned the user interface on paper
- Following a Tkinter tutorial
- Began to build the graphical user interface in the test.py
- Tried to add a scrollbar to the window
- Had to use a Listbox as the widget type because it is the only one that will allow me to scroll
- Added tools.py to the library, added in a function to it that grabs the Auth key of a service
- Moved the graphics from the test.py to a library module
- Ran into difficulty getting the steam api calls to fit into the OOP graphical module

January 5th, 2016
- Got a client (Peter Fajner) to test it on his windows 10 machine
- The buttons are the incorrect colour, this will need to be fixed
- Got the steam api calls into the Tkinter update loop
- Optimized the steam API call to make a single call for all entries rather than two calls per entry

January 6th, 2016
- Minor cleanup
- Began to work on testing another api with the app (League of Legends)
